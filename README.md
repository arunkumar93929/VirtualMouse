# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse using Python and OpenCV

Welcome to the **Virtual Mouse** project! This is a computer vision-based application that allows you to control your computer's mouse using just your hand gestures, powered by Python and OpenCV! Perfect for touch-free interactions, this project is fun to use and a great intro to the power of computer vision. 🚀

## 📘 Overview

The Virtual Mouse project leverages Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe (for hand tracking) to:
- Detect hand movements and gestures in real time 👋
- Map these gestures to mouse actions like click, scroll, and drag 🎛️
- Enable hands-free interaction with your computer! 

With this project, you’ll be able to control the cursor simply by moving your hand, creating an innovative alternative to traditional mouse usage.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python** 🐍 for coding the application logic
- **OpenCV** 📸 for video processing and hand detection
- **Mediapipe** ✋ for hand landmarks and gesture recognition
- **PyAutoGUI** 🎛️ for controlling mouse actions programmatically

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.
2. **Webcam** (built-in or external) to capture video for gesture recognition.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-mouse.git
   cd virtual-mouse

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-mouse.git
   cd virtual-mouse

   
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries using:

bash


Copy code


pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui


Run the Application: Start the Virtual Mouse by running the main Python script:



bash
Copy code
python virtual_mouse.py


🧰 How It Works   
The application performs three main steps:



Capture Video Feed 🎥: Continuously captures frames from the webcam to analyze in real time.



Detect Hand Gestures ✋: Uses Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks and track gestures, such as index finger up (move cursor), pinching fingers (click), etc.

Map Gestures to Mouse Actions 🖱️:

Move Cursor: Moving your index finger moves the cursor.
Left Click: Pinching your thumb and index finger together triggers a left-click.
Right Click: Pinching with a specific gesture (e.g., thumb + middle finger) triggers a right-click.
Scroll: Up or down movements with specific finger gestures trigger scroll actions.
✋ Hand Gestures and Actions
Gesture	Action
Index Finger Up	Move Cursor
Thumb + Index Finger Pinch	Left Click
Thumb + Middle Finger Pinch	Right Click
Swipe Up/Down with Fingers	Scroll
Note: Gestures can be customized in the code if you want to change the mappings!



🎥 Demo
Here’s what using the Virtual Mouse looks like in action:



Note: Add demo GIF or screenshots of the Virtual Mouse in action if available.



📝 Code Structure
virtual_mouse.py: Main file that captures video feed, processes gestures, and maps gestures to mouse actions.
helpers.py (optional): Utility functions for hand gesture recognition and drawing landmarks on frames.


🧪 Testing and Usage Tips
Optimal Lighting 💡: Ensure you are in a well-lit environment to improve hand detection accuracy.
Clear Background 🎯: Use a plain background to reduce distractions in hand tracking.
Adjust Detection Sensitivity 🔍: Customize hand detection confidence threshold in the code if gestures aren’t recognized properly.


🔧 Customization
To modify gestures or mouse mappings, edit the following sections in virtual_mouse.py:
Gesture Recognition: Customize hand landmark detection logic.
Action Mapping: Change PyAutoGUI function calls to map to different gestures.


🚀 Future Improvements
Here are a few ways we can make this Virtual Mouse even cooler:

Multi-Hand Support: Enable gestures using both hands simultaneously.
Customizable Sensitivity: Add UI for users to adjust sensitivity without changing the code.
Gesture-Based Keyboard Typing: Add additional gestures to type on a virtual keyboard.
